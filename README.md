In an 8-week group project using Unreal Engine and C++, I worked with a team of talented graphic designers and programmers. My main role was to build the entire power-up system from scratch, using Enumerators to manage different types of power-ups. Due to time constraints, the game included only two power-ups, but I designed the system to make it easy to add more in the future. I also developed the user interface (UI) for the power-up system to create a smooth and intuitive experience for players.
